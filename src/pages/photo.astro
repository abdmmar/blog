				<p class="mb-4">
					I never truly developed an interest in photography until I reached
					high school. Back then, I would occasionally borrow a friend's camera,
					wander around, and take random photos without understanding the
					fundamentals of photography. Years passed without me giving much
					thought to pursuing it as a hobby, until one afternoon during Eid
					al-Fitr, I stumbled upon my late grandfather's old camera, the Yashica
					Electro 35 GSN. 
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">
					To use this film camera, I had no choice but to learn the basics of
					photography on my own. I didn’t last long with it, mainly because of
					the high cost of film rolls. Every attempt I made at capturing images
					with the camera ended in failure—but it was a failure I found oddly
					rewarding. A year later, I purchased my first camera.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">
					Even now, I’m still learning and I often feel that my knowledge of
					photography is limited. But I’ve come to realize that photography is a
					powerful way to preserve moments, express emotions, and communicate an
					artistic vision. Capturing images of loved ones, the world around me,
					and the unexpected moments in life has made photography a deeply
					fulfilling experience.
